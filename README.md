# ECE-final-project
Final project for my bachelor degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Politecnico di Torino, academic year 2024/2025.
This project was developed in parallel with the Signal and system course.

## Overview
The assigned task consisted of two points:
* Filtering out from two songs a sinusoidal disturbance, comparing the SIR (Signal to Interference Ratio) using either a 4th order Bessel filter
and a custom designed FIR filter
* Simulate the bandpass transmission on a band-limited channel of both the song together
